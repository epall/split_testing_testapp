Story: tester roles
  As a tester
  I want to have roles
  So that I don't have to individually enable features every time something comes out
  
  Scenario: role granting access
    Given a user
    And a restricted feature 'coolnewthing'
    And a role 'ubertester'
    And a page with feature 'coolnewthing'
    When the user has the role 'ubertester'
    And the role 'ubertester' is enabled for feature 'coolnewthing'
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should show the feature 'coolnewthing'
    
  Scenario: role not granting access
    Given a user
    And a restricted feature 'coolnewthing'
    And a role 'ubertester'
    And a role 'zzzzz'
    And a page with feature 'coolnewthing'
    When the user has the role 'ubertester'
    And the role 'zzzzz' is enabled for feature 'coolnewthing'
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should not show the feature 'coolnewthing'
