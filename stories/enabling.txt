Story: enabling features
  As a developer
  I want to enable and disable features on a granular basis
  So that the right users see the appropriate features

  Scenario: enabling access
    Given a user
    And a feature 'awesomeness'
    And a page with feature 'awesomeness'
    When the feature 'awesomeness' is enabled
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should show the feature 'awesomeness'
    
  Scenario: disabling access
    Given a user
    And a feature 'awesomeness'
    And a page with feature 'awesomeness'
    When the feature 'awesomeness' is disabled
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should not show the feature 'awesomeness'
  
  Scenario: preferential access
    Given a user
    And a feature 'beta'
    And a page with feature 'beta'
    When the feature 'beta' is enabled
    And the feature 'beta' is enabled for the user
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should show the feature 'beta'
  
  Scenario: preferential access with a broken feature
    Given a user
    And a feature 'broken'
    And a page with feature 'broken'
    When the feature 'broken' is disabled
    And the feature 'broken' is enabled for the user
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should not show the feature 'broken'
  
  Scenario: restricted access granted
    Given a user
    And a restricted feature 'restricted'
    And a page with feature 'restricted'
    When the feature 'restricted' is enabled
    And the feature 'restricted' is enabled for the user
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should show the feature 'restricted'
  
  Scenario: restricted access denied
    Given a user
    And a restricted feature 'restricted'
    And a page with feature 'restricted'
    When the feature 'restricted' is enabled
    And the feature 'restricted' is disabled for the user
    And the page is rendered
    Then the page should not show the feature 'restricted'
